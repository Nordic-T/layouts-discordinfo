# Discord-info Widget (Layout) for Discourse
... will be filled sometimes before 2020.

Remember to add [Discourse Layouts](https://github.com/angusmcleod/discourse-layouts) first!

# To-do
- Put info in widget, if layouts_discordinfo_identifier isn't provided, any maybe other stuff...
- Change icon-solution, cause Discourse complaning about this. `DEPRECATION: Use `{{d-icon}}` instead of `{{fa-icon}}`


# Fixed
- ~~Hide "join now" if the user is foind in the informations from Discord~~ : Added 15-05-2018
- ~~Get Travis to work...~~ : Skipped, cause it's currently [not needed](https://github.com/angusmcleod/layouts-custom-html/issues/3#issuecomment-386853184).
